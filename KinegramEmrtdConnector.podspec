  spec.description   = <<-DESC
    Enable the Document Validation Server (DocVal Server) to read and verify an eMRTD via a WebSocket v2 connection.

    V2 solves the iOS 20-second NFC timeout issue by moving APDU exchanges to the device. Instead of relaying
    every APDU through the server (causing latency to accumulate), V2 performs bulk reading locally and uses
    the server only for security-critical operations.

    The DocVal server is able to read the data (like MRZ info or photo of face) and verify the
    authenticity and integrity of the data.
    If the eMRTD supports the required protocols, the DocVal Server will additionally be able to verify
    that the chip was not cloned.
    The DocVal Server will post the result to your **Result-Server**.
